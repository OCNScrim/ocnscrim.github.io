{"name":"OCNScrim Home","tagline":"OCNScrim Plugin Development Team","body":"### Welcome to the homepage of OCNScrim Plugin Development Team.\r\nWe are a group of people that are very inspired by Overcast Network's PGM plugin. In our Scrimmage plugins, we aim to imitate it. At the moment, we do not have a fully working version of the plugin. [**Scrimmage**](http://github.com/RainoBoy97/Scrimmage) and [**Scrimmage2**](http://github.com/OCNScrim/Scrimmage2) have now ceased development, but [**Scrimmage3**](http://github.com/OCNScrim/Scrimmage3) is actively being worked on.\r\n\r\n### Members\r\nOur team is currently very small, but we always welcome additions. Feel free to contact us wherever you see us, and if you don't email us at [ocnscrim@gmail.com](mailto:ocnscrim@gmail.com).\r\n* [msalihov](http://github.com/msalihov)\r\n* [RainoBoy97](http://github.com/RainoBoy97)\r\n* [TheAtro](http://github.com/TheAtro)\r\n\r\nPlease note that the usernames listed above are GitHub usernames.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nContributing to our plugins is easy, just send us a pull request, and if your code is of acceptable quality, we'll accept it! You can also become an official member of the team by either sending us a bunch of pull requests, or by shooting an email to [ocnscrim@gmail.com](mailto:ocnscrim@gmail.com).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
